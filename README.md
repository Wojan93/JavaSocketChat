# JavaSocketChat
Chat application in Socket technology with Java FX

Application done in Eclipse IDE.

ChatClient - client application, you should launch it after the server app. 
You can have many client windows (min. 2, just open JavaFX application twice).

WebSocket is the server application. I have launched this application on Glassfish 4.
